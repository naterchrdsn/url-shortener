# URL Shortener UI

This is a simple UI for the URL shortening tool built with Angular and Angular Material.

## Prequisites

* Node.js

## Installation

1. cd to the frontend directory

2. npm install

## Overview

This tool features both pieces of functionality in the specification:
- An input that takes a long url and returns a unique short url with an alphanumeric string as masking.
- An input that takes the short url key and returns the original url details.

- I scaffolded out the frontend using Angular CLI.
  
  * Angular Material for UI components
  * Single page for the URL shortening tool

- I added some basic validation as well:

  * url to shorten must be a valid URL
  * only alphanumeric characters allowed in the short code input
